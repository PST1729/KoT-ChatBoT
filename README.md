# KoT-ChatBoT
Our team has developed a cutting-edge ChatBot for KIIT University, powered by Python, Pytorch, and NLP concepts. 
This deep learning model is designed to quickly and accurately address all college-related doubts that students may have, 
from admissions to certifications and everything in between. With over 1000+ students set to access the ChatBot across 
the college, we have created a seamless and interactive experience via KoT (a popular communication platform) 
that allows students to easily chat and get their questions answered. 
Our ChatBot goes beyond simple Q&A and utilizes advanced features like personalized responses based on student data, 
integration with the university's knowledge base and FAQ section, and even a sentiment analysis module to provide 
empathetic and thoughtful responses. We are confident that our ChatBot will greatly enhance the student experience at 
KIIT University and revolutionize the way students get the information they need.<br />
